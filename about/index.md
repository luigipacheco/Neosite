# About Me  
I graduated from La Salle Bajío in León Mexico with a degree in architecture. I also have a Master in Robotics and Advanced Construction from [IAAC](http://www.iaac.net) in Barcelona. This master specializes in new technologies for design and digital manufacturing in the architecture and construction industry.
I have been involved in the DIY/Maker movement since 2011 when I started using 3D printing to make architectural models, eventually I assembled a 3D printer which lead me to co-found [MakerMex](http://www.makermex.com) (2012) the first Mexican company to develop and manufacture 3D printers. I directed operations and projects in MakerMex from 2012 - 2020.
